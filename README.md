# Excel2SepaXML

Hello and welcome,</br></br>
this is a simple Excel VBA Project which is intended to create valid SEPA XML files for bank transfer.</br>
I searched a long time to find a solution for processing excel lists to SEPA XML files. The solutions i found didn´t statisfied at all.</br></br> I decided to write my own solution to solving this problem. Today i want to share my work with you.</br>
Feel free to contribute or take parts of the code and use it for your own suppose but be careful and check generated XML files with your bank if they will work with their system.</br>
Bank data, such as SWIFT Codes and IBAN numbers will be checked if they´re valid - but only with regular expressions and calculating if the checking number has the right value.</br></br>
You can get further information about this tool on my website (german).
